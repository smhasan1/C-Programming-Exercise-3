1. Write a program that display an isosceles triangle that made of '*'. The program reads an integer from the standard input. Then it display on the standard output a triangle with the base equal to n *'s. The row above that have n-2 *'s and so on until the first row contains either 1 or 2 *'s (depending on n being odd or even).  

2. Write a program that displays a rectangle on the screen. The program reads from the standard input three parameters, width, height, and a character. Them it display a rectangle with width and height using the character read. For example, if the input 7 5 x.  

3. Write a program that encodes a message. The message is read from the standard input. The key is an integer (k). The program arranges the message in a r-by-K rectangle. Then the program displays the message column by column. For example if the key is 11, the message is  
  If you are looking for ransom, I can tell you I don't have money. But
  what I do have are a very particular set of skills, skills I have acquired
  over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like
  you\n  
The program arranges it in a x-by-22 matrix (the number of columns is 22)  
  If you are looking for
   ransom, I can tell yo
  u I don't have money.
  But what I do have are
   a very particular set

Then, the output is displayed column by column
